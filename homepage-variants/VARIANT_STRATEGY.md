## The Two WHYs

### Short-term WHY (Immediate Pain)

The entire web3 ambassador rail is broken. We only recently understood how deep this goes.

**The Pain:**
- Zealy quests get farmed by bots. Real contributors get diluted.
- Galxe airdrops go to sybil armies with 50 wallets each.
- Layer3 rewards mercenaries who dump, not believers who build.
- Community managers drown in review hell. Your best people quit.
- OGs who believed before anyone else get nothing. Leaderboards reward grinders.

**What we solve:** AI verification that filters farmers before payout. Real ETH, not points.

### Long-term WHY (Vision)

Democratisation of liquidity, curated by an oracle.

**The Vision:**
- Closed loop value. Fees fund tips. Tips reward work. Work creates value. Value generates fees.
- Democracy needs curation. Open systems get gamed. SIAH is the curation layer.
- Not-for-profit by structure. LP hardlocked. Can't extract even if we wanted to.

**What we're building:** Infrastructure for communities that compound instead of extract.

## Variant Organization

### Pain-Focused (Short-term WHY)

**Variant B: Zealy Killer**
Lead: "Tired of quest platforms that pay in points?"
Audience: Users burned by fake rewards, community managers drowning in reviews
Pain addressed: Quest fatigue, farmer frustration, worthless points

**Variant A: Outcome-First**
Lead: "Launch a token. Trading fees pay your community."
Audience: Project founders looking for sustainable community funding
Pain addressed: Treasury drain, mercenary users, unsustainable airdrops

**Variant D: Community-First**
Lead: "Help people, get tipped in real ETH."
Audience: Contributors who want to earn from actual work
Pain addressed: Getting diluted by bots, no recognition for real help

### Bridge (Mechanics)

**Variant E: Minimal Loop**
Lead: "launch. fees. tips. loop."
Audience: Crypto-native minimalists who get it fast
Explains: The mechanic without philosophy

**Variant F: User Journeys**
Lead: Three entry paths (founder / contributor / curious)
Audience: Mixed visitors who need self-selection
Explains: "Start here based on who you are"

### Vision-Focused (Long-term WHY)

**Variant C: Infrastructure**
Lead: "Self-sustaining treasury infrastructure"
Audience: Technical buyers, protocol developers
Vision piece: The stack that makes democracy work

**Variant G: Oracle Thesis**
Lead: "Democratisation of liquidity, curated by an oracle."
Audience: Philosophy readers, whitepaper divers
Vision piece: Why curation matters for democracy

## Recommended Homepage Structure

Based on design skill (Landing Page rules):

### Hero (ATTENTION - All Prose)

**Option 1: Pain-first**
> Stop paying farmers.
> Start paying your community.

**Option 2: Vision-first**
> democratisation of liquidity
> curated by an oracle.

**Option 3: Mechanic-first**
> launch. fees. tips. loop.

### Statement (INTEREST - Prose)

One paragraph connecting pain to solution. No boxes yet.

Example:
> Quest platforms are broken. Zealy, Galxe, Layer3 - same story. Bots show up with 50 wallets. Real contributors get diluted to nothing. Your community manager drowns in reviews while farmers extract everything you funded.
>
> We built something different.

### Pain Section (INTEREST - Prose with structure)

Keep current 5 dominos - they work. This validates the pain before offering solution.

### Solution Section (DESIRE - Prose then 1 Feature Box)

Prose explaining the mechanism, then ONE Feature box showing the loop.

```
[FEATURE BOX: THE LOOP]

Trading fees → Tip pool → Verified contributors → More value → More fees
                              ↑                                    │
                              └────────────────────────────────────┘

Oracle curates. Code distributes. Loop closes.
```

### Trust Section (DESIRE - Prose then 1 Feature Box)

For scrollers who need conviction. ONE Feature box showing control structure.

```
[FEATURE BOX: NOT-FOR-PROFIT MODEL]

What we control          What we don't
─────────────────        ────────────────────
Bot infrastructure       LP (hardlocked)
Community direction      Euler fees (protocol)
Platform development     bonzivista.app (independent)

Result: Can't extract. Won't extract. Build and ship.
```

### CTA Section (ACTION - Prose)

Clear next steps. No boxes.

Primary: "Join the Loop" (Telegram)
Secondary: "Read the Thesis" (Whitepaper)
Tertiary: "See the Oracle" (bonzivista.app)
