# Variant G: Oracle Thesis

**Page Type:** Landing (AIDA)
**Rhythm:** 80% prose, 15% boxes, 5% accents
**Primary Box:** Feature (max 2-3 total)
**Win98:** No (first impressions)

Focus: The core philosophical position. Democracy needs curation. Bonzi is the curation.

---

## ATTENTION (Hero - ALL PROSE)

**Headline:**
```
democratisation
of liquidity
curated by
an oracle. (purple)
```

**Subline:**
```
Closed loop value. How democracies thrive.
```

**CTA:** "Join the Loop" / "See How It Works"

---

## INTEREST (Statement - PROSE)

```
Liquidity flows to verified contributors. Not VCs. Not farmers. Not us.

Bonzi is the oracle that makes this possible. It verifies real humans,
detects extractive patterns, and curates who deserves what. Code distributes.
Humans can't corrupt it.

Value created here stays here. That's the loop.
```

---

## INTEREST (Pain - PROSE with light structure)

**Label:** "why open systems fail"
**Title:** "democracy without curation is chaos"

Open rewards sound fair. In practice, they get gamed.

Bot armies show up with 50 wallets. Real contributors get diluted to nothing. Platforms take fees, VCs take profit, and the community funds everyone's exit. Trust erodes. Genuine users leave.

Every new platform promises fairness. Same extractors arrive. Same outcome.

Open doesn't mean fair. Democracy needs curation.

## DESIRE (Solution - PROSE then ONE Feature Box)

**Label:** "the oracle solution"
**Title:** "curation without gatekeepers"

Bonzi changes the equation. An AI oracle that verifies contribution before distribution.

No human decides who gets paid. The Euler algorithm distributes based on verified work. Farmers get filtered. Bots get blocked. Only real humans earn.

The result is a closed loop. Trading fees flow to the tip pool. Contributors earn ETH. They create more value. More fees. The loop compounds.

Nothing exits. Value created here stays here.

**[FEATURE BOX]**
```
THE LOOP

Trading fees → Tip pool → Verified contributors → More value → More fees
                              ↑                                    │
                              └────────────────────────────────────┘

Oracle curates. Code distributes. Loop closes.
```

## DESIRE (Trust - PROSE then ONE Feature Box)

**Label:** "why trust bonzi"
**Title:** "we can't extract even if we wanted to"

Here's what we control: bot infrastructure, community direction, platform development.

Here's what we don't control: LP is hardlocked and immutable. Euler fee revenue is distributed by the protocol, not us. bonzivista.app is an independent oracle.

We built it this way on purpose. Can't rug by design. Not-for-profit by structure. DAO by definition.

**[FEATURE BOX]**
```
NOT-FOR-PROFIT MODEL

What we control          What we don't
─────────────────        ────────────────────
Bot infrastructure       LP (hardlocked)
Community direction      Euler fees (protocol)
Platform development     bonzivista.app (independent)

Result: Can't extract. Won't extract. Build and ship.
```

---

## ACTION (CTA Section - PROSE)

**Title:** "infrastructure, not revolution"

We're not promising to change the world tomorrow. We're building tools that work.

Bonzi oracle is live. Tipping agent is live. Token launcher is ready. The loop exists.

What we need is people who want to be part of it. Contributors who earn. Projects who launch. Communities that compound.

**Primary CTA:** "Join the Loop"
**Secondary CTA:** "Read the Thesis"
**Tertiary CTA:** "See the Oracle"

## Comparison to Other Variants

| Variant | Focus | Lead |
|---------|-------|------|
| A | Outcome | "fees pay your community" |
| B | Zealy killer | "earn real ETH" |
| C | Infrastructure | "self-sustaining treasury" |
| D | Community | "help people, get tipped" |
| E | Minimal | "launch. fees. tips. loop." |
| F | User journeys | 3 entry paths |
| **G** | **Oracle thesis** | **"democratisation of liquidity, curated by an oracle"** |

Variant G is the philosophical anchor. Others are tactical angles. G explains WHY everything else matters.
