## ATTENTION (Reveal Section)

```
Line 1: "help people"
Line 2: "get tipped"
Line 3: "in real"
Line 4: "ETH." (purple)
```

## INTEREST (Statement)

```
"answer questions, verify raids, help newcomers. every contribution tracked.
every tip on-chain. 100 points = claim ETH. no farming. no fake points."
```

## INTEREST (Pain Section)

**Label:** "why helping others doesn't pay"

**Title:** "communities reward the wrong people"

**Subtitle:** "the contributor paradox"

**Items:**
1. **helpers get ignored** - You spend hours helping newcomers. Farmers complete 50 tasks. Farmers win.
2. **OGs get diluted** - Day-ones who believed early don't grind points. Mercenaries climb the leaderboard.
3. **quality doesn't matter** - Copy-paste tweets count the same as original content. Why try harder?
4. **tips go nowhere** - "Thanks!" in chat. No ETH. No points. Appreciation doesn't pay rent.
5. **no reputation** - Help 100 people, nobody knows. Start fresh in every community. No portable rep.

**Conclusion:** "being genuinely helpful is a losing strategy."

## DESIRE (Solutions Section)

**Label:** "how you earn with bonzi"
**Title:** "real rewards for real help"

1. **ask & earn** - Ask genuine questions. AI scores depth and novelty. 1-10 points per question. Farmers can't fake curiosity.
2. **raid & earn** - Submit screenshot. AI verifies tweet exists, content is original, account is real. Instant points.
3. **help & get tipped** - Answer questions. Other members tip you ETH directly. On-chain, instant, no middleman.
4. **leaderboard tracks value** - Not task counts. Who's actually helping? Quality-weighted scoring.
5. **100 points = ETH** - Claim from community pool. Pool funded by trading fees. Always has funds.
6. **portable reputation** - Your score follows you. Built once, recognized everywhere.

## ACTION (CTAs)

**Primary:** "Start Earning"
**Secondary:** "See the Leaderboard"

## Key Messaging Change

FROM: "ambassador engine" (project-focused)
TO: "help people, get tipped in real ETH" (contributor-focused)

## Tone

Empathetic. Speaks to the frustration of genuine contributors who get ignored.
