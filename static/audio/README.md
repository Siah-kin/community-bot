# Audio assets

This directory contains a tiny **placeholder** audio file used by the public website so the UI can ship without copyrighted music.

If you self-host and want background music:

1. Replace `placeholder.wav` with your own licensed audio
2. Update the `<audio>` sources in the site pages (search for `bg-music`)
