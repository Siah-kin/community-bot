## ATTENTION (Reveal Section)

```
Line 1: "zealy points"
Line 2: "are worthless"
Line 3: "earn real"
Line 4: "ETH." (purple)
```

## INTEREST (Statement)

```
"no more grinding for $2 airdrops. launch tokens free. trading fees fund
community tips automatically. AI catches farmers. only humans get paid."
```

## INTEREST (Pain Section)

**Label:** "the quest platform scam"

**Title:** "you grind. they profit."

**Subtitle:** "5 reasons your points mean nothing"

**Items:**
1. **points ≠ money** - Complete 100 tasks. Get 10,000 points. Convert to... $3. The platform kept the rest.
2. **farmers win, you lose** - Professional extractors with 50 wallets. They got the airdrop. You got diluted.
3. **reviews take forever** - Submit raid. Wait 3 days. "Pending review." Reviewer quit. Start over.
4. **budgets run out** - "Rewards paused due to high demand." Translation: they ran out of money.
5. **bots everywhere** - Half the leaderboard is fake accounts. But they completed the tasks, so they win.

**Conclusion:** "you're not earning. you're being farmed."

## DESIRE (Solutions Section)

**Label:** "the fix"
**Title:** "points backed by real money"

1. **free launch, real fees** - Deploy token on EtherFun. Every trade generates fees. Fees → your community.
2. **auto-funded forever** - Treasury fills itself from trading activity. No budget limits. No "paused" messages.
3. **AI catches farmers** - Pattern detection, account verification, originality checks. Bots get nothing.
4. **instant payouts** - 100 points = claim ETH. To your wallet. No conversion. No waiting.
5. **real work = real money** - Help someone? Get tipped. Complete raid? Points. Points = ETH.
6. **no middleman** - Open source. On-chain. Verify everything. We can't rug because we don't hold funds.

## ACTION (CTAs)

**Primary:** "Start Earning Real Money"
**Secondary:** "See the Proof"

## Key Messaging Change

FROM: "ambassador engine" (corporate speak)
TO: "zealy points are worthless. earn real ETH." (direct attack)

## Tone

Angry. Direct. No bullshit. Speaks to frustration.
