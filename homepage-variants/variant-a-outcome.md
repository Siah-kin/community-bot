Focus: Lead with what users GET, not what we do.

## ATTENTION (Reveal Section)

```
Line 1: "launch a token"
Line 2: "fees pay your"
Line 3: "community"
Line 4: "automatically." (purple)
```

## INTEREST (Statement)

```
"free token launch on EtherFun. trading fees flow straight to community tips.
AI verifies real contributors. bots get nothing. real ETH payouts for real work."
```

## INTEREST (Pain Section)

**Label:** "Galxe, Zealy, Layer3, Crew3, TaskOn, QuestN"

**Title:** "what do they all have in common?"

**Subtitle:** "points that mean nothing"

**Items:**
1. **grind for weeks, get $2** - Your time is worth more than fake points that convert to dust.
2. **farmers extract everything** - Bot armies with 50 wallets take the airdrop. You get diluted.
3. **manual review hell** - Someone has to check every submission. They quit. You wait forever.
4. **treasury runs dry** - Projects fund rewards manually. Budget runs out. Program ends.
5. **no way to verify real work** - Copy-paste tweets, bot accounts, recycled content. All approved.

**Conclusion:** "extraction theatre on steroids."

## DESIRE (Solutions Section)

**Label:** "how bonzi is different"
**Title:** "self-funding community treasury"

1. **free token launch** - Deploy on EtherFun via Vista API. Gas only (~$0.05). No platform fees.
2. **auto-funded treasury** - Every trade generates fees. Fees flow to community pool. No manual funding.
3. **AI verification** - Screenshots checked. Accounts verified. Farmers detected. Only humans earn.
4. **instant ETH tips** - 100 points = claim ETH. Not tokens. Not promises. Real money.
5. **tracks real value** - Not task counts. Who's helping? Who's creating? Who's onboarding newcomers?
6. **lives in your chat** - Telegram, Discord. No new dashboard. No new login. Where your people already are.

## ACTION (CTAs)

**Primary:** "Launch Free Token"
**Secondary:** "See How It Works"

## Key Messaging Change

FROM: "ambassador engine" (vague)
TO: "fees pay your community automatically" (outcome)
