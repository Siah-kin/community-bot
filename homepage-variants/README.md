# Homepage Copy Variants

These are **text-only** alternatives for the Bonzi homepage. Same layout, colors, fonts - just different messaging.

Each variant follows AIDA:
- **A**ttention: Hero/reveal section
- **I**nterest: Pain points section
- **D**esire: Solutions section
- **A**ction: CTAs

## Current Copy (Original)

```
REVEAL:
"launch your brand with a token and an ambassador engine."

STATEMENT:
"free token launch. AI-verified raids. real ETH payouts. every submission
checked by vision AI trained on 6 months of raid data. farming doesn't
scale here. do real work, get real money."
```

## The Problem

Current copy doesn't surface the **unique value prop**:
- Free launch via EtherVista API
- Trading fees → community tip pool (automatic)
- Self-sustaining treasury
- Only humans earn (AI verification)

This is what differentiates us from 100k other AI agents.
