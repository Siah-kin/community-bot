## Session: 2026-01-24 - Launch Generator Redesign

### Design Philosophy

> "This Design does not fit Cramped between LARGE FONT text and Another Section... This Can better be almost as large as the previous font size and Written as a sentence So its more spectacle... Then we need a GO button but one that fits the moment"

> "the purple line around and background should go away, and we should make the grey a purple looking interface, and ensure the logo of bonzi appears in gold and 4 times in original color"

> "I asked to treat it as a sentence and not a button, remove the button keep the text, then below it have a Button with Tokenise"

### UX Standards

> "text is jumping with flicker, which is not good and font need to be the same size as flickering text"

> "remove those fucking emoticons fuck"

> "that button with tokenise is ugliest i ever seen and also not big enough"

> "Dude Why flickering word is just to damn close"

> "the space between your and the flick word is too small, the flick words flickering is push the your to the left all the time making it appear buggy"

### Slot Machine Requirements

> "keep the 100 words flickering ofcourse"

> "make sure golden monkey is in sync with wheel and 5 bonzi in a row.."

> "Stop no more white bonzi, it became gold bonzi"

> "the white hearts have to be removed, no more emoticons"

> "I need you to enlarge the word screen and push bonzi logo in between..."

> "CAROUSEL ALWAYS ENDING IN MIDDLE NOT GOOD"

> "the slot bar is also going out of its boundaries.. look at right flank"

> "golden bonzi or other purpel bonzis not appearing in list of 100 words and golden flickering only happeing on the right side"

> "but there are no Bonzi logo's in the wheel of 100 words?"

### Speed/Timing

> "flickering words no more fast? please solve this we need very fast words, and no more Launch Your movement"

> "but its too slow"

> "WORDS FLICKERING TOO Fast"

### Access

> "remove IP block"
