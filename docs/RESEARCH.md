# Research Notes

Bonzi / SIAH is built around a simple thesis:

> Open communities get gamed. Trust must be measured from behavior, not identity.

This repo includes public-facing research artifacts in:

- `metrics/whitepaper.html` (full whitepaper)
- `metrics/whitepaper-lite.html` (short version)
- `economics/` (closed-loop model + incentives)
- `manual/` (operator docs)

## Multi-oracle approach

SIAH combines multiple signal sources and normalizes them into a composite score, designed to reduce single-signal gaming and sybil incentives.

## Closed-loop agent economics

Core principle: reward comes from **real yield** and verified contribution loops (not inflationary emissions).

## Where the implementation lives

The backend implementation (API, trust aggregation, bot services) lives in `Bonzi_v5`.
