# Variant C: Infrastructure Play

Focus: For project founders and developers. Technical credibility. "This is a primitive, not a product."

## ATTENTION (Reveal Section)

```
Line 1: "self-sustaining"
Line 2: "community treasury"
Line 3: "for token"
Line 4: "projects." (purple)
```

## INTEREST (Statement)

```
"launch on EtherFun. trading fees auto-fund community rewards. AI verifies
contributors. open source. on-chain. no platform fees. powered by EtherVista."
```

## INTEREST (Pain Section)

**Label:** "why community programs fail"

**Title:** "treasuries run dry"

**Subtitle:** "the manual funding problem"

**Items:**
1. **budget-dependent** - Community rewards require ongoing funding. Budget runs out, program dies.
2. **farmer extraction** - 80% of airdrop goes to sybils. Actual community gets diluted to nothing.
3. **review bottleneck** - Manual verification doesn't scale. Reviewers burn out. Quality drops.
4. **platform lock-in** - Zealy owns your data. Galxe owns your users. You pay rent on your own community.
5. **no flywheel** - Activity doesn't generate revenue. More users = more costs, not more sustainability.

**Conclusion:** "community programs are cost centers, not flywheels."

## DESIRE (Solutions Section)

**Label:** "the infrastructure"
**Title:** "activity funds itself"

1. **free token deployment** - EtherFun via Vista API. Creator address = your tipping agent. Gas only.
2. **fee-funded treasury** - Every swap → fee → community pool. Trading activity funds rewards automatically.
3. **AI verification layer** - Vision AI checks screenshots. Pattern detection flags sybils. Scales infinitely.
4. **on-chain tips** - ETH tips, instant settlement. No custody. No middleman. Verify on explorer.
5. **open source** - MIT license. Self-host or use hosted. Fork it. Audit it. We hide nothing.
6. **multi-tenant** - One deployment serves multiple communities. Shared sybil intelligence across tenants.

## ACTION (CTAs)

**Primary:** "Deploy for Your Project"
**Secondary:** "Read the Docs"

## Key Messaging Change

FROM: "ambassador engine" (marketing fluff)
TO: "self-sustaining community treasury" (infrastructure primitive)

## Tone

Technical. Credible. Speaks to builders, not users.
